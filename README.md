Classification of gender based on audio signals

Problem-statement: The problem here is to classify the gender of the participitant based on the audio input. We will be using Supervised Machine Learning Models by using features from the librosa python package to retrive information.

Note: All the participants are labelled manually as female or male since the demographic data is not given

*2) What's Intresting about it*

This project helps to classify the gender based on this we can intrepet many others charecterstics based on the gender for further analysis.This project gives an insight to work with different audio features to classify its environment.

Additionally this project gives an inference of machine learning model that best suits this application. Furthermore, We will explore different methods to choose best hyperparameteters and compare the effectiveness of supervised models for this application.Moreover, this project can be extended to classify age by extracting more additional features.
